    desc: "<p>Digital currency is a rising and emerging industry, and it is also a sunrise industry. However, the difficulties and bottlenecks encountered in the development of digital currency, fake projects, platforms running away, and a mixed situation, are not allowed by the digital currency industry. The tragedy of the industry that is not directly confronted. It can be said that these ill-intentioned projects have greatly lowered the credibility of digital currency. In the smart arbitrage industry, these irresponsible products have severely damaged the credibility of digital currency and made the industry slump. However, arbitrage is just a platform. The main reason for these problems is that different users do not know what real arbitrage is, and their judgment is stunned by false propaganda, and there is a lack of effective supervision. For customer service platforms, if the conscience platform is resisted and harmed indiscriminately because of these black sheep, everyone will be hurt.<br/>In 2017, Alpha launched the Bitcoin intelligent arbitrage product after years of research and development: Brick Arbitrage. The product was officially released in December, and it took less than a month after its launch. It became popular in the currency circle. It was not only popular among senior digital currency investors, but also became a star product, and the number of agents doubled. And what is the magic that makes this product affirmed by so many people, and what kind of product is Alpha that can be recognized by so many people?In fact, Alpha's background is not small, and it can be said to be strong. Alpha is a global one-stop quantitative arbitrage safe created by a team that has successfully managed 40 billion quantitative funds. In addition to the arbitrage treasure launched this time, the previously launched trend arbitrage, take profit and stop loss, multi-factor currency selection products, etc. are also popular in the market, and their reputation has exploded. This intelligent brick-moving arbitrage product is built by a team that graduated from well-known schools such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University and has more than ten years of experience in computing the market, and its strength is extraordinary.<br/>Returning to the essence of the product, a strong team background and strength can only mean that this product is trustworthy, but if the product does not have a good effect, it is obviously meaningless to make no money or lose money. Therefore, The popularity of Alpha Arbitrage is due to Alpha's good reputation and strong strength, but the root cause is that the product itself has good benefits, otherwise the endorsement of the team alone is useless. It can win the trust and love of so many people, so what kind of product is Brick Arbitrage?<br/>We already know its status by birth. In fact, as a new product that Alpha has sharpened for many years, it is actually an artifact and a very targeted product. After in-depth research on the digital currency market, Alpha adopts a cloud arbitrage architecture with a built-in arbitrage engine. It has obvious advantages such as the fastest market capture, the most accurate volume and price mining, the most portfolio monitoring, and the most stable risk control. It is Alpha's promise not to collect coins, not to issue coins, to place coins only in personal trading accounts, and to increase coins and not decrease.<br/>The birth of a good product not only requires strong R&D strength and actual test, but also whether the team develops the product with heart, and the birth of an excellent product will also feed back the team, prove the excellence of the team, and serve the team and users. Bringing good benefits, the two promote each other and complement each other, and some products with bad intentions will not only smash the industry's signboard, but will be cast aside by others, but will also face severe legal punishment. Alpha not only brings good products and intelligent arbitrage, but also benefits many digital currency practitioners and injects fresh and healthy blood into the industry. Such a team will eventually become the industry leader. At the same time, Alpha arbitrage treasure The powerful effect of the platform redefines the so-called intelligent arbitrage. Only such a platform can be called excellent </p>",
